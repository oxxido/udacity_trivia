# Full Stack API Final Project

## Frontend

- I added a CSS framework to help some specific ui details i like to improve
- Changed the size, position and aligment of the menu
- Created (downloaded) a logo
- Changed sizes, spacing, cursor style, etc
- Reworked each question on "list", changed position, added more style
- Modified the search location and style
- Modified the add new trivia


## Backend

- Requirements asked to "... POST endpoint to get questions based on a search term." but i prefer to use CRUD recommendations and add the search to the GET 
endpoint, because I manage to create an entire new behaviour (search question)
by just adding a couple of lines of code.
